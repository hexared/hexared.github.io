      <description>&gt;$ whoami &gt;$ whoami I&#39;m Matteo Pernarella, a DevSecOps engineer and (recently) penetration tester and bug hunter. My life basically depends by the blink of a cursor, outside my terminal i&#39;m just a guy who loves to learn something new and understand how things works. I&#39;ve started working as a Software engineer during my first year of University, was involved in developing a k8s clone based on python and ansible, here is where my curiosity about DevOps started along with a major interest in cybersecurity.</description>
