<p>I&rsquo;m Matteo Pernarella, a DevSecOps engineer and (recently) penetration tester and bug hunter.</p>
<p>My life basically depends by the blink of a cursor, outside my terminal i&rsquo;m just
a guy who loves to learn something new and understand how things works.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started working as a Software engineer during my first year of University,
was involved in developing a k8s clone based on python and ansible, here is where
my curiosity about DevOps started along with a major interest in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>From there, my path branched into a junior security consultancy position, i was
in charge of basic network configuration and securty, going on in the future as
Systems, Network and Security engineering for another company where i was able to
infiltrate in highly skilled collegues and learn how everything in a large distributed
infrastructure should work and i was just in time to partecipate in some of my first pentests
and incident response.</p>
<p>In the meantime i graduated in Computer science and started
my master degree in cybersecurity, only to discover some time later that the coursework
was a bit underwhelming, pushing me to drop it and start learning things on my own.</p>
<p>Back then, my rush to become a jack of all trades stopped and i went back on the DevOps
path for a while, where i&rsquo;ve discovered that was possible to mix up DevOps and
Cybersecurity ending up with DevSecOps.</p>
<p>From time to time i like to play some ctf to sharpen my skills and have fun; but when i want to
shutdown everything i go for an hike or a rock climb.</p>
<p>Was that all? of course not; i&rsquo;m still learning everything i can to always improve myself.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s basically me in a <del>bash</del> nutshell.</p>
