        I'm Matteo Pernarella, a DevSecOps engineer and (recently) penetration
        tester and bug hunter.
        </p>
        <p>
        My life depends on the blink of a cursor, but outside my terminal, I'm just
        a guy who loves to learn something new every day and tries to understand how things work.
        </p>
        <p>
        I started working as a Software engineer during my first year of University and
        I was involved in developing a K8s clone based on Python and Ansible.
        This is where my curiosity about DevOps started, along with a major interest
        in cybersecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
        From there, my path branched into a junior security consultancy position,
        i was in charge of basic network configuration and security, evolving in
        the future as Systems, Network and Security engineering for another italian
        company where I was able to infiltrate a team with highly skilled colleagues
        and learn how everything in a large distributed infrastructure should work and
        I was just in time to participate in some of my first pentests and incident
        response.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the meantime I graduated in Computer science and started my master's
        degree in cybersecurity, only to discover sometime later that the coursework
        was a bit underwhelming and outdated, pushing me to drop it and start learning
        things on my own. Back then, my rush to become a jack of all trades stopped and
        I went back on the DevOps path for a while, where I discovered that was
        possible to mix up DevOps and Cybersecurity ending up with DevSecOps, and
        here we are walking again on a thin line between infrastructures and cybersecurity...
        </p>
        <p>
        From time to time I like play some CTF to sharpen my skills and have
        fun; some other times i enjoy closing Vim and go for a hike or climbing.
        </p>
        <p>
        Was that all? of course not;<br>
        but that's basically me in a <strike>bash</strike> nutshell,
        loving linux, wrestling with infrastructures and diving into cybersecurity.
