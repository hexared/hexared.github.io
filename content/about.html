        I'm Matteo Pernarella, a DevSecOps engineer and (recently) penetration 
        tester and bug hunter. 
        </p>
        <p>
        My life depends on the blink of a cursor. Outside my terminal, I'm just 
        a guy who loves to learn something new every day and understand how things work.
        </p>
        <p>
        I started working as a Software engineer during my first year of University.
        I was involved in developing a K8s clone based on Python and Ansible. 
        This is where my curiosity about DevOps started, along with a major interest 
        in cybersecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
        From there, my path branched into a junior security consultancy position, 
        i was in charge of basic network configuration and security, going on in 
        the future as Systems, Network and Security engineering for another company 
        where I was able to infiltrate a team with highly skilled colleagues and 
        learn how everything in a large distributed infrastructure should work and
        I was just in time to participate in some of my first pentest and incident 
        response.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the meantime I graduated in Computer science and started my master's 
        degree in cybersecurity, only to discover sometime later that the coursework
        was a bit underwhelming, pushing me to drop it and start learning things 
        on my own. Back then, my rush to become a jack of all trades stopped and 
        I went back on the DevOps path for a while, where I discovered that was 
        possible to mix up DevOps and Cybersecurity ending up with DevSecOps, and 
        here we are...
        </p>
        <p>
        From time to time I like to play some CTF to sharpen my skills and have 
        fun; but when I want to shut everything I go for a hike or a rock climb.
        </p>
        <p> 
        Was that all? of course not;<br>
        I'm still learning everything I can to always improve myself. And that's 
        basically me in a <strike>bash</strike> nutshell.
