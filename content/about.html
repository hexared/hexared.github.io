        I'm Matteo Pernarella, a DevSecOps engineer and (recently) penetration tester and bug hunter.
        </p>
        <p>
        My life basically depends by the blink of a cursor, outside my terminal i'm just
        a guy who loves to learn something new and understand how things works.
        </p>
        <p>
        I've started working as a Software engineer during my first year of University,
        was involved in developing a k8s clone based on python and ansible, here is where
        my curiosity about DevOps started along with a major interest in cybersecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
        From there, my path branched into a junior security consultancy position, i was
        in charge of basic network configuration and securty, going on in the future as
        Systems, Network and Security engineering for another company where i was able to
        infiltrate in highly skilled collegues and learn how everything in a large distributed
        infrastructure should work and i was just in time to partecipate in some of my first pentests
        and incident response.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the meantime i graduated in Computer science and started
        my master degree in cybersecurity, only to discover some time later that the coursework
        was a bit underwhelming, pushing me to drop it and start learning things on my own.
        Back then, my rush to become a jack of all trades stopped and i went back on the DevOps
        path for a while, where i've discovered that was possible to mix up DevOps and
        Cybersecurity ending up with DevSecOps, and here we are...
        </p>
        <p>
        From time to time i like to play some ctf to sharpen my skills and have fun; but when i want to
        shutdown everything i go for an hike or a rock climb.
        </p>
        <p> 
        Was that all? of course not; i'm still learning everything i can to always improve myself.
        And that's basically me in a <strike>bash</strike> nutshell.
